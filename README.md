# PhysicsEssentials

PhysicsEssentials is a Python toolkit catered for quick applications in physics. It comprises of several classes for different tasks: plotting, analysis etc. This toolkit is still in the process of being developed. 

NOTE: The current master branch is now Python 3 only.  



## Install

For installation, clone this repository into your local drive. For linux, use the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/36sneharam/PhysicsEssentials.git

You will also need to install the following libraries to access the full toolkit:

 - numpy 
 - matplotlib
 - sklearn 
 - statsmodels.api
 - sys
 - mpl_toolkits.mplot3d
 - os
These libraries can be installed using the pip command
